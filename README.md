# Variable_friction_finger
## Steps to run the finger gripper node
### Setting things up:
### Workspace:
1. Download the repository into a catkin workspace.
2. Make the dev and build files by running this command.
> catkin_make

### Arduino:
1. Create the ros libraries for the arduino.
> rosrun rosserial_client make_libraries path_to_library 
2. This will create a ros_lib foder on the given path.
3. Now open the arduino installation folder and inside the libraries paste the ros_lib folder(Note: If one exists, delete it and paste the new one)
6. Copy the arduino code and burn it to the arduino board.
7. Check whether the arduino is connected to ACM0 port and the baud rate is set as 57600.

### Connecting the dynamixel:
(Note: This code is tested with XM430-W350 dynamixels(Protocol 2.0) motors only. For other motors, not supported)
1. Connect the dynamixel to USB0 and set the baud rate to 57600.
2. Set the Left Finger Motor ID:20 and Right Finger Motor Id:21 in the dynamixel wizard.
3. Incase if you want to change the motor id in the friction finger code, open the friction_finger_gripper/src/controller.cpp and modify as mentioned in the code.

### Launching the finger_gripper:
1. Run the following commands in different terminals:
> roscore
2. Launch the low level controller node.
> rosrun friction_finger_gripper controller_node 
If the controller is launched properly, you should see the message "Constructor with parameters initiated" printed twice on screen as there are two fingers.
3. Launch the high level controller node
> rosrun friction_finger_gripper high_level_controller_node 
4. Launch the Arduino
> rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py
If the serial node is launched properly, you should see the msgs Setup service server on Friction_surface_Right [common_msgs_gl/SendBool] ,Setup service server on Friction_surface_Left [common_msgs_gl/SendBool] on the screen.


### Extracting the limits for the motor positions:
1. Keep the finger in home position(open position) and check whether the thread is attached tight with the finger. Then run the command
> rosservice call /read_pos 
2. This will give the current position of the motors.
Example: [1.0371184371184372, 0.6036630036630036]  -->[Left,Right]
3. Similarly the fingers at 90degree and run the same command. From this you can understand how the limit and the range of values which can be given.

### Testing
### Available services:
(Note: The commands given below are with default values, change it according to your motors and need)
1. Hold the object: Enter the position values for left and right motor accordingly
> rosservice call /Hold_object "left: 0.0
right: 0.0" 

2. Slide Left up: Need to enter Right finger motor values, because during left finger up action, right finger is position controlled and the left is torque controlled
> rosservice call /Slide_Left_Finger_Up "data: 0.0" 

3. Slide Right up: Left motor value
> rosservice call /Slide_Right_Finger_Up "data: 0.0" 

4. Slide Left Down: Left motor value
> rosservice call /Slide_Left_Finger_Down "data: 0.0" 

5. Slide Right Down: Right motor value
> rosservice call /Slide_Right_Finger_Down "data: 0.0" 

6. Rotate clockwise: Left motor value
> rosservice call /Rotate_clockwise "data: 0.0"

7. Rotate anticlockwise: Right motor value
> rosservice call /Rotate_anticlockwise "data: 0.0"

8. Read Motor Position:
> rosservice call /read_pos
